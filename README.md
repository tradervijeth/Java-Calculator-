This repository contains a simple Java-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

## Features:
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.
- **Error Handling**: Includes checks for division and modulo by zero to prevent runtime exceptions.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The calculator is implemented as a class with methods for each operation, making it easy to extend and reuse.
